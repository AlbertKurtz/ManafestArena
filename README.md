# Manafest Arena 1.0
![Manafest: Arena](/Textures/logo.jpg)
This game is a FOSS video game developed using [another repo](https://github.com/blukatstudios/FPS_Project)'s develop branch
as a starting point. (At the time of writing there's a terrible merge conflict on master branch that needs fixing up)
This is an effort to work on creative elements of game design instead of spending 100% of the time working on things
that are virtually invisible and under the hood.

## Premise


Control a champion in a series of arena matches to become the victor.

## Development

Manafest: Arena has been completed. A retrospective/post-mortem will be created
to explore challenges as well as what worked and didn't work. This should
ideally be created by April 4th, 2019 and come before the start of the next
project. That document should be the last update for this 3-month build period.

If want to use parts, or the entirety of this repo to make a video game, 
feel free to do so. It has served its purpose to me as an exercise of 
programming, art, game design, and project management.
