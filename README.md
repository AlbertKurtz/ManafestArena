# Manafest Arena
![Manafest: Arena](/Textures/logo.jpg)
This game is a FOSS video game developed using [another repo](https://github.com/blukatstudios/FPS_Project)'s develop branch
as a starting point. (At the time of writing there's a terrible merge conflict on master branch that needs fixing up)
This is an effort to work on creative elements of game design instead of spending 100% of the time working on things
that are virtually invisible and under the hood.

## Premise

Control a fighter in Carthage's **Global Championship**, a gameshow of blood, gore and triumph! 
Perform valiantly in career of arena matches, attract **corporate sponsors**, and deck out
your fighter with **items and abilitities** in order to become Carthage's world champion.
