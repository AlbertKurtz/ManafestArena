# Manafest Arena
![Manafest: Arena](/Textures/logo.jpg)
This game is a FOSS video game developed using [another repo](https://github.com/blukatstudios/FPS_Project)'s develop branch
as a starting point. (At the time of writing there's a terrible merge conflict on master branch that needs fixing up)
This is an effort to work on creative elements of game design instead of spending 100% of the time working on things
that are virtually invisible and under the hood.

## Premise

Control a champion in a series of arena matches to become the victor.
